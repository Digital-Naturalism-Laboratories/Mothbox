Note: Items that have been fixed are placed into the CHANGELOG.txt file and then deleted from this file

Things that need fixing:
------------------------

- Double check the 5V supply delivers plenty of current
		- See suggestions on rpi forums, note how they say the XL4015 might be slow, so maybe extra good cap near input!:
		Likely a mix of voltage-drop and old firmware.
		Measure 5 V at the Pi under load (camera/VNC) – must stay ≥ 4.9 V.
		Use short, thick 5 V / GND paths on the HAT; add 470-2200 µF cap near input.
		***** XL4015 can sag on fast spikes — compare with a good 5 A USB-C PD supply.
		Keep PSU_MAX_CURRENT=5000 and stay on latest EEPROM/firmware; updates have improved brown-out handling.
		Check vcgencmd get_throttled & journalctl for undervoltage logs.


- Make sure the external attractor can deliver plenty of power. Some folks are connecting 48-60watt attractors

- Pi Pin numbers are reversed?


Haven't yet tested:
-------------------

- Leaving lights on for a long time

- GPS

- Regulator enabler mosfet

- Double battery fit with smaller camera case?

- Glare from camera

- Andy to measure the board current using INA219 and multimeter across R4   I=V/R

- Andy to measure voltage drop across two Photo LED Resistors, for example: R10 and R20 while switched on. Also measure the voltage drop from R10 & R20 to GND.  This will tell us the current being used by a string of LEDs on the Left and Right side. 



Things I tested that did work:
------------------------------

-The i2c voltage meter totally works!

- the i2c muxes work (i can communicate with them, but don't have pull ups so not useful)

- attractors turn on!

- Photo lights turn on!


Future Changes:
---------------

- add a MCU with RTC that controls all the on and off times of the whole system for even better power management. NOTE: this needs prototyping to test comms between the two devices:  MCU <--> RPi
