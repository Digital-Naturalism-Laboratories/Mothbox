Things that need fixing:


-The ambient light sensor I added in 501 doesn't work (hahahha probably because i didn't connect DVI to ANYTHING) the BH1750FVI-TR LCSC C78960
it should be fixed, or replaced with something we know works!

-The Muxes should be replaced with the version that has the pull up resistors

- add something that controls the power to the MUXes so they don't just constantly leech power except for when we want to read their state


- Attractor 1 and 3 labels are switched i think

- can move attractor labels out from under the foot print?

- Silkscreen - we should put the test point labels on both sides of the board

-"Attractor 3" has a resistor under its footprint. Should move

-IMPORTANT: Silkscreen of regulated 12v is reversed! (Double check other silkscreen labels)

- IMPORTANT: R3 on andy's BOM was wrong! should also be a little lower ( 3.0kohm) to make the voltage around 5.1 5.2 v for rpi to stop complaining so much about low voltage

- 5v test point is awkwardly under an LED on one side

- Add holes for zip ties of extra battery! 



Haven't yet tested:

- Leaving lights on for a long time

-GPS

-Regulator enabler mosfet

- Double battery fit with smaller camera case?

- Glare from camera


Things I tested that did work!

-The i2c voltage meter totally works!

- the i2c muxes work (i can communicate with them, but don't have pull ups so not useful)

- attractors turn on!

-Photo lights turn on!


Future Changes

- add a MCU with RTC that controls all the on and off times of the whole system for even better power management
