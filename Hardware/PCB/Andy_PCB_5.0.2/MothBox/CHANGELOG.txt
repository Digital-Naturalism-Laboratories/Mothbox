Project Name: MothBox Main PCB



PCB Versions:
-------------

Version 5.0.3:
Production:  JLCPCB, 2 Layers, 1.6mm, Green, 238mmx141mm 
Date: TBD

* add double ++-- to the three side power green/orange connector labels and backside
* change fuse from 1812 3A to 2920 6A?  Have to move IAN219 over a bit
* decrease IAN219 sense resistor from 0.1 ohm to 0.033 ohm
* remove old MB: text label and box from backside
* do something about the D7, D6, D5, D2 ESD diodes.  Increase from 12V, to 18V or 45V? (AQ - I am still puzzled by this mystery, maybe just remove them? Nothing on this board is too Electro static discharge sensitive anyway right?
* Move RPi 5V cap to be above (otherside) of RPi, so the RPi can lay flat, or replace with a shorter version?  Tantalum cap? (AQ-  can't fit that big capacitor above the board either, it will block sliding the pi in)
* fix R + L Flash LED labels to something like: L/R FLASH LED GND?
* add Talentcell Battery part numbers? (e.g. PB120B1) and larger font 
* whats happening to the two S/N boxes? (AQ - keep the square one, leave space below it (or move it to where it has space below)
* do something about the EXT Temp Sensor label?
* move C5 and R33 label around the DS18B20 temp sensor box
* change 1.5V text to 1.5A on the external connector
* rotate input power connector 90 deg.
* move the 'Active' label on the U11 switch to the RH side.
* add --++ label to front side of PCB on the input connector
* add two solder jumpers accross R4 so we can bypass the current measuments
* Add Aducam camera P/N text? Arducam 64MP OV64A40 OwlSight
* move and rotate 3V3 line MOSFET labels, + R36, C??
* rotate H1 + U8 GPS connector labels
* make GPS box outline a bit smaller


Version 5.0.2:
Production:  JLCPCB, 2 Layers, 1.6mm, Green, 238mmx141mm 
Date: 2025-09-TBD

Done: AQ- swapped green indicator LED (C72043) which LCSC says is discontinued  for  C2289 which is dirt cheap and plentiful
Done: AQ - change the user switch to use the ALWAYS on 3v3 power so that a user could always be able to push it, and then it could trigger a script to enable the other 3.3v
Done: Aq - scoot items out of where batteries might be
Done: Silkscreen - we should put the test point labels on both sides of the board
Done: add a user switch
Done: add a user LED
Done: MOSFET switch the entire 3V3 line out of the RPi connector to minimise 3.3V quiescent current usage. 
Done: add a SMD DS18B20 PCB temperature sensor
Done: add provision for an external DS18B20 temperature sensor. Need a 4.7K ohm resistor and a 1.25mm 3-pin connector
Done: remove 3V3 input leading to the ePaper hat connector as it has it's own built in 5V to 3V3 regulator
Done: Swap out the PCA9535 MUX to the PCA9555PW(UMW) as this has pullup resistors: C42420607
Done: fix the two Attractor 3 labels.  One should be #1
Done: can move attractor labels out from under the foot print?
Done: Move resistor R22 out from underneath Attractor 3 footprint
Done: 5v test point is awkwardly under an LED on one side
Done: Silkscreen of regulated 12v is reversed! (Double check other silkscreen labels)
Done: change R3 to a lower value (3K Ohm) so as to raise the voltage to 5.2V for the RPi
Done: add an extra resistor close to R3 (Vf power), so feedback voltage can be easier to fine tune
Done: swap out the BH1750FVI-TR LCSC: C78960 to the cheaper LTR-303ALS-01 ambient light sensor: C364577, US$0.38/ea, DFN-6(2x2)
Done: remove: GPIO4/pin8 from RPi-ePaper.  Reroute to DS18B20
Done: construct a stronger ground plain
Done: Add an extra 6 (2 x 3) Photo LEDs to PCB
Done: added Power input/Output direction arrows for each connector
Done: modified Serial Number Box shape - andy added anothere switched it back because JLCPCB needs certain dimensions to automaticaly put the serial and QR code on


Version 5.0.1: 
Production:  JLCPCB, 2 Layers, 1.6mm, Green, 238mmx141mm 
Date: 2025-05-18

Done: design and laid out by building on the 5.0.0 design and user feedback
Done: upgraded white LEDs to be twice as bright (500mW)
Done: replaced switch multiplexer IC's with i2C based IC's
Done: added an extra switch bank for another 8 hours of config options
Done: reversed ePaper screen so it's on the other side of PCB
Done: swapped out the MOSFETs for different and cheaper versions
Done: added a reverse polarity protection MOSFET to power input
Done: swapped out the green input connectors from a horizontal to vertical connectors
Done: swapped out the 0805 fuse to a larger 1812 6A fuse
Done: as there are now more i2C IC's on the bus, the i2C pullup resistor values where dropped to 4.7K ohm
Done: added a project URL QR code to the PCB
Done: general clean up of the schematic
Done: add a BH1750FVI-TR light sensor (second v5.0.1 version)
