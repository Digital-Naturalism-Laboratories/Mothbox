Project Name: MothBox Main PCB


PCB Versions:
-------------

Version 5.0.1: 
Production:  JLCPCB, 2 Layers, 1.6mm, Green, 238mmx141mm 
Date: 2025-05-18

* design and laid out by building on the 5.0.0 design and user feedback
* upgraded white LEDs to be twice as bright (500mW)
* replaced switch multiplexer IC's with i2C based IC's
* added an extra switch bank for another 8 hours of config options
* reversed ePaper screen so it's on the otherside of PCB
* swapped out the MOSFETs for different and cheaper versions
* added a reverse polarity protection MOSFET to power intput
* swapped out the green input connectors from a horizontal to vertical connectors
* swapped out the 0805 fuse to a larger 1812 6A fuse
* as there are now more i2C IC's on the bus, the i2C pullup resitor values where dropped to 4.7K ohm
* added a project URL QR code to the PCB
* general clean up of the schematic
