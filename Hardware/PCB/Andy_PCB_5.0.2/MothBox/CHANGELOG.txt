Project Name: MothBox Main PCB



PCB Versions:
-------------

Version 5.0.2:
Production:  JLCPCB, 2 Layers, 1.6mm, Green, 238mmx141mm 
Date: 2025-09-TBD


- Swap out the PCA9535 MUX to the PCA9555PW(UMW) as this has a pullup resistor: C42420607

- add a MOSFET to switch power to the PCA9555 MUXes to minimise quiesent current usage.

- Attractor 1 and 3 labels are switched i think

- can move attractor labels out from under the foot print?

- Silkscreen - we should put the test point labels on both sides of the board

- Add holes for zip ties of extra battery! Will need input ASAP from Andy on where these need to go.  Can we add some generic bolt hoes, and then use a laser cut mounting frame?

Done: Move resistor R22 from under Attractor 3 footprint
Done: 5v test point is awkwardly under an LED on one side
Done: Silkscreen of regulated 12v is reversed! (Double check other silkscreen labels)
Done: change R3 to a lower value so as to raise the voltage to 5.2V for the RPi
Done: swap out the BH1750FVI-TR LCSC: C78960 to the LTR-303ALS-01 ambient light sensor: C364577, US$0.38/ea, DFN-6(2x2)


Version 5.0.1: 
Production:  JLCPCB, 2 Layers, 1.6mm, Green, 238mmx141mm 
Date: 2025-05-18

* design and laid out by building on the 5.0.0 design and user feedback
* upgraded white LEDs to be twice as bright (500mW)
* replaced switch multiplexer IC's with i2C based IC's
* added an extra switch bank for another 8 hours of config options
* reversed ePaper screen so it's on the otherside of PCB
* swapped out the MOSFETs for different and cheaper versions
* added a reverse polarity protection MOSFET to power intput
* swapped out the green input connectors from a horizontal to vertical connectors
* swapped out the 0805 fuse to a larger 1812 6A fuse
* as there are now more i2C IC's on the bus, the i2C pullup resitor values where dropped to 4.7K ohm
* added a project URL QR code to the PCB
* general clean up of the schematic
