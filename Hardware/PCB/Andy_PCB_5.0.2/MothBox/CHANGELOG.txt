Project Name: MothBox Main PCB



PCB Versions:
-------------

Version 5.0.3:
Production:  JLCPCB, 2 Layers, 1.6mm, Green, 238mmx141mm 
Date: TBD

* add double ++-- to the three side power green/orange connector labels


Version 5.0.2:
Production:  JLCPCB, 2 Layers, 1.6mm, Green, 238mmx141mm 
Date: 2025-09-TBD

Done: AQ- swapped green indicator LED (C72043) which LCSC says is discontinued  for  C2289 which is dirt cheap and plentiful
Done: AQ - change the user switch to use the ALWAYS on 3v3 power so that a user could always be able to push it, and then it could trigger a script to enable the other 3.3v
Done: Aq - scoot items out of where batteries might be
Done: Silkscreen - we should put the test point labels on both sides of the board
Done: add a user switch
Done: add a user LED
Done: MOSFET switch the entire 3V3 line out of the RPi connector to minimise 3.3V quiescent current usage. 
Done: add a SMD DS18B20 PCB temperature sensor
Done: add provision for an external DS18B20 temperature sensor. Need a 4.7K ohm resistor and a 1.25mm 3-pin connector
Done: remove 3V3 input leading to the ePaper hat connector as it has it's own built in 5V to 3V3 regulator
Done: Swap out the PCA9535 MUX to the PCA9555PW(UMW) as this has pullup resistors: C42420607
Done: fix the two Attractor 3 labels.  One should be #1
Done: can move attractor labels out from under the foot print?
Done: Move resistor R22 out from underneath Attractor 3 footprint
Done: 5v test point is awkwardly under an LED on one side
Done: Silkscreen of regulated 12v is reversed! (Double check other silkscreen labels)
Done: change R3 to a lower value (3K Ohm) so as to raise the voltage to 5.2V for the RPi
Done: add an extra resistor close to R3 (Vf power), so feedback voltage can be easier to fine tune
Done: swap out the BH1750FVI-TR LCSC: C78960 to the cheaper LTR-303ALS-01 ambient light sensor: C364577, US$0.38/ea, DFN-6(2x2)
Done: remove: GPIO4/pin8 from RPi-ePaper.  Reroute to DS18B20
Done: construct a stronger ground plain
Done: Add an extra 6 (2 x 3) Photo LEDs to PCB
Done: added Power input/Output direction arrows for each connector
Done: modified Serial Number Box shape - andy added anothere switched it back because JLCPCB needs certain dimensions to automaticaly put the serial and QR code on


Version 5.0.1: 
Production:  JLCPCB, 2 Layers, 1.6mm, Green, 238mmx141mm 
Date: 2025-05-18

Done: design and laid out by building on the 5.0.0 design and user feedback
Done: upgraded white LEDs to be twice as bright (500mW)
Done: replaced switch multiplexer IC's with i2C based IC's
Done: added an extra switch bank for another 8 hours of config options
Done: reversed ePaper screen so it's on the other side of PCB
Done: swapped out the MOSFETs for different and cheaper versions
Done: added a reverse polarity protection MOSFET to power input
Done: swapped out the green input connectors from a horizontal to vertical connectors
Done: swapped out the 0805 fuse to a larger 1812 6A fuse
Done: as there are now more i2C IC's on the bus, the i2C pullup resistor values where dropped to 4.7K ohm
Done: added a project URL QR code to the PCB
Done: general clean up of the schematic
Done: add a BH1750FVI-TR light sensor (second v5.0.1 version)
