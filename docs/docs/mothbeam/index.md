# Origin
Moritz at [LabLab](https://lablab.eu/) originally designed the [Mothbeams](https://certification.oshwa.org/de000156.html). He created them to be open-source, low cost, high power, modular, adapatable insect attractors! Many other lights available can cost $100-$700 USD, and so we wanted a cheaper option. We have been using pairs with one PCB with a range of UV, and another PCB with an array of useful visible light.
