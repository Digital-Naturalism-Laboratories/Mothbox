#  Internal Mothbeam
We have been using the awesome Mothbeam made by Moritz at [LabLab](https://lablab.eu/). He designed these PCBs to be super low cost, high power, modular, adapatable insect attractors! We have been using pairs with one PCB with a range of UV, and another PCB with an array of useful visible light.

To get one, you can:
* order them from him by emailing him (moritz@lablab.eu) (the cheapest way), and they are about $90 for a pair.
* [order them from circuithub](https://circuithub.com/projects/Moritz/Mothbeam/revisions/57895/parts) (the most expensive way)
* or because it's open source, you can get the files from circuithub and make the PCBs yourself! The tricky part is that because they are high power LEDs, they are made on a heat-dissipating aluminum substrate. Keep that in mind!

What's nice is you can arrange them in different ways. You can put them together in a container and use it just like a Lepiled or other portable insect attractors. You could then connect these assembled "Mothbeams" as an ["External Attractor"](https://digital-naturalism-laboratories.github.io/Mothbox/docs/building/attractor/#external-12v-uv-light)
