#  Origin
Moritz at [LabLab](https://lablab.eu/) originally designed the [Mothbeams](https://certification.oshwa.org/de000156.html). He created them to be open-source, low cost, high power, modular, adapatable insect attractors! Many other lights available can cost $100-$700 USD, and so we wanted a cheaper option. We have been using pairs with one PCB with a range of UV, and another PCB with an array of useful visible light.

# Parts

A mothbeam is easy to put together and has 3 main parts:

* PCB
  * The electronic LED board that shines really bright (generally UV or Visible Options)
  * generally made on alumnimum backing to help shed heat. (Copper could work too, but it's expensive!) 
* Heatsink
  * usually a piece of metal to help dissipate the heat to give the LEDs a longer life
* Housing
  * Something to protect the electronics from travel or the elements

## PCB

The PCB's are a [certified open source hardware design originally by Moritz](https://certification.oshwa.org/de000156.html). We have [remixed them to easily connect to our Mothbox PCB](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/tree/main/Hardware/PCB/AndyMothbeam_forMBv5.0.1).

To get one, you can:
* order a Mothbeam directly from Moritz in Germany emailing him (moritz@lablab.eu)
* use the [open source files](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/tree/main/Hardware/PCB/AndyMothbeam_forMBv5.0.1) to create your own PCBs yourself (or via something like JLCPCB) (remember they need to be aluminum PCBs)
* [order them from something like circuithub](https://circuithub.com/projects/Moritz/Mothbeam/revisions/57895/parts) (the most expensive way)


## Heatsink
The heatsink just needs to be something big and metal we can connect the PCB to.

## Housing
The flexibility of this low cost device means you can put together different types of housings however you need.

You can go super low-cost and just put it in a recycled sports-drink bottle

or you can [laser cut a fancier flat-pack design](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/tree/main/Hardware/Mothbeam_Housing/Mothbeam_Flatcontainer)

you can even use the basic concepts in this tutorial and make a "Mega Mothbeam" by just using more PCBs and longer heatsink.

For this tutorial, we will show you how to make a very simple mid-range housing we call the "Basic Circular Housing"

# Rundown of Parts to Gather for Basic Circular Housing

* PCBs (ideally 2 or 4)
* 18awg solid core wire (red and black)
* 20x20 aluminum profile (15cm long)
* Circular Plexiglass tube (make sure transparent to UV)
* Laser cut [Top and Bottom lid](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/tree/main/Hardware/Mothbeam_Housing/Mothbeam_CircularHousing)
* Cable Ties (Basic nylon high heat resistant)
* (optional) Silicone heat transmitting pads
* (optional) DC barrel jack (socket and plug)
* (optional) Electronic Snap connectors
