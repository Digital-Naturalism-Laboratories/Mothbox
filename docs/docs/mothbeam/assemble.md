# Connect PCBs to Metal

If you have the optional thermal transfer silicone pads, you can attach those to the backs of the mothbeams. If you don't have them, don't worry.

Place a mothbeam on each side of the metal rod. (If you are using 4 pcbs, you probably want to arrange them in a star shape if their edges interfere with each other.)
![20251029_163529](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1af985bf-e299-45e8-ab05-ac5782dac819)

Use a cable tie to go through the tops of the PCBs to hold them snugly against the metal. 

If your ties are too thick to go through the holes, you can just go around the PCB.

You could also drill holes in the metal and connect your mothbeams even better to the metal (this would be the ideal, non-lazy choice, and it will offer and even tighter coupling)


Add more zip ties to bind the bottom area of the PCB to the metal.

Snip ends of ties

# Set PCB power

There are little switches that can determine how much energy your PCBs output. The more power, the brighter the LEDs and maybe the more chances they will attract bugs. Conversely your battery will run out quicker and the device will produce more heat.

You can use the end of a wire to move the tiny switches.

In this image I set the first three switches. This is probably the reccomended HIGH power mode (350mA).  You can flip the final switch, but that is ULTRA MAX power mode (450mA). 2-3 switches is good for attracting lots of bugs.

The power values selectable are

* 120mW (12v @10mA)
* 960mW (12v @80mA
* 1800mW (12v @150mA) 
* 3600mW (12v @300mA)
* 5400mW (12v @450mA)

# Wire PCBs

Cut 2 10cm red and black wires
Cut 2 20cm red and black wires

Connect the black wire between two of the GND (-) ports of the Mothbeam.

Connect the Red wire between two of the +12V ports of the Mothbeam.

Add the two long wires to the middle of one PCB

![20251029_164407](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91347f97-01fe-4441-bd2f-d6c3c1fd5b76)


(Optional) Hot glue the wires gently into place

![20251029_164652](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ad6cec6-a81f-4a89-88a9-4f558d5304f2)

You can now test if your wiring is correct by connecting it to power.

# Build Housing
Slide the top lid (the lid with no extra hole), onto the metal rod. Hot glue it to the rod. (If you are working with very high heat LEDs you might want to use epoxy, but normally hot glue is fine)

![20251029_164830](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ff46c24-49c0-4e7a-badc-ef6473bea1e2)


Now slide the acrylic tube around the PCBs.

![20251029_164908](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c0cd5f7-5701-4212-8257-3df049ba9bf0)


Next, slide the bottom lid on and slide the long wires through its hole.

![20251029_164926](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13410d91-5a6e-4255-a884-427651621f4c)

![20251029_164956](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df92f2ab-71f3-4f50-b2a3-070eca089bce)

Glue the top lid to the metal shaft.

![20251029_165023](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/780d92f5-acd5-4f62-afb3-db79c7281d22)


Glue the wire hole closed.

![20251029_165102](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f27be5a1-3b6f-4d90-b787-a0001e16704b)


Finally, glue the acrylic tube to the lids to seal the whole device

# Connect the power wires
Finally you can connect the GND(-) and 12V (+) wires to the way that you will give it power. 
We demonstrate with connecting to a DC Barrel Jack.

# Test it out!
Plug it into a battery, yay it works!

![20251029_165545](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/287dd1d2-6626-49fe-af49-3a008e594e63)


Note that the metal may get HOT in use!
