# Connect PCBs to Metal

If you have the optional thermal transfer silicone pads, you can attach those to the backs of the mothbeams. If you don't have them, don't worry.

Place a mothbeam on each side of the metal rod. (If you are using 4 pcbs, you probably want to arrange them in a star shape if their edges interfere with each other.)

Use a cable tie to go through the tops of the PCBs to hold them snugly against the metal. 

If your ties are too thick to go through the holes, you can just go around the PCB.

You could also drill holes in the metal and connect your mothbeams even better to the metal (this would be the ideal, non-lazy choice, and it will offer and even tighter coupling)


Add more zip ties to bind the bottom area of the PCB to the metal.
