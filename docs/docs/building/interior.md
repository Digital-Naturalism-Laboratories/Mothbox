The inside of the mothbox has also been improved in version 4.0

There is only one laser cut mainboard, and it fits more securely inside the box.

There are 11 laser cut pieces you will assemble with electronics parts.

Finally, using two M2 screws, you can attach the Camera into place

# Ringlights

## Disassemble RingLight

## Connect Ringlight

### First Side
Feed the wires of the ringlight through the hole and position it flat against the mainboard.
![PXL_20240528_220841309](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/4f6cf390-ff8e-4120-af89-6f4546f5224c)

Add zipties in these two locations to secure it.
![PXL_20240528_220848536](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/7361216e-7226-4c31-bc23-418397c1125e)

One rightlight should be finished and attached like this!


![PXL_20240528_220852183](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/abac79cb-3ceb-478f-b910-7bbc837a81e8)

### Second Side
Place the second ring light with the wires towards the big open gap

![PXL_20240528_221239622](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/2f16ea18-048b-4787-a625-1ef429a1bd6d)
You can zip its wires in place to stop them from getting tangled in things and help protect them
![PXL_20240528_221257355](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/92ea5c0a-3e20-48d7-a837-731dcb4ba20e)

Add zipties through these two holes
![PXL_20240528_221243294](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/b241f36d-b417-4dda-8d66-3a8db11dbfd6)


# Connect the Raspberry Pi
It sits in the corner. The four holes it connects to are marked with an extra tiny hole so you know which holes to line up.
![image](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/b8fccf42-da9d-4776-9406-c5989ae9c8a8)

![image](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/fffef7b3-921b-49cc-8629-786a10ecbf41)


We will only connect 3 of the holes of the Raspberry Pi, because one is hidden behind the ringlight. (If you wish to connect the 4th hole, make sure to use a plastic bolt.)


Add three of the spacers on top of the Pi's holes like this.
![image](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/05b1540c-ab99-4aa9-9acb-91b6bbcc82f7)

Screw them in from the other side
![PXL_20240528_221455180](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/1eea97a5-2d5c-49d1-970c-071a9e4d9f7c)

## Connect the RTC battery
Make sure to plug the battery into the Pi5's little battery slot. This battery keeps the clock accurate even if the pi loses power.
![PXL_20240528_221654951](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/7b368f8d-57c8-43cb-b7c4-463ab8504b19)


# Trim Your Zip ties
Now is a good time to trim up the ends of the zip ties you have sticking around
![PXL_20240528_221836961](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/b8328173-9122-4dd3-b99b-1df50e9d9fef)

# Connect the camera cable to the Raspberry Pi
Connect the ribbon cable to the raspberry pi
if you are using a Pi5, make sure to connect to the first slot labeled "Cam0"
![PXL_20240528_231930368](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/f4a7a9ed-f9fc-4d4a-a23b-6be467ee18d4)

# Attach Relay hat to Pi
You will now connect the sockets on the relay hat to all the shiny metal pins sticking out of the pi.
First move the camera ribbon cable to the side of the bolt sticking out of the pi
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f082ca1-ee8c-4688-bc48-480ec85297f6)

Place the relay hat on top of the Pi. Line up the GPIO pins, and press softly down.

> [!WARNING]  
> Be careful to not pinch the ribbon cable going to the camera

## Tape the RTC battery on top of the relays

This is just to keep it out of the way. and to stop it from getting tangled.

Attach a piece of double sided tape to the little battery.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77edf203-c352-4862-b33e-d91cd66cfc32)
> [!NOTE]  
> This image kinda looks like there are too many fingers.

stick it on top of the relay.
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Don't block the screw holes on top of the relay.

# Connect the Battery

Unscrew these three screws from the bottom of your Battery
![image](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/a54fb25a-e785-4e21-a92b-25b139c71ca9)
save the screws.
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Make sure to press down firmly when unscrewing the screws so you do not strip the heads.

Now screw the screws back in, connecting the battery to the mainboard.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d443341-2b62-4a2f-be2c-140cb7a30071)

# Add the Clips to Mainboard
Now you can attach all the little plastic standoff clips to the edges of the mainboard. These hold the mothbox electronics firmly in place inside the plastic box.
> [!NOTE]  
> If your mainboard still has protective plastic, you might need to peel it off from the mainboard before attaching the clips. Sometimes the protective plastic makes the acrylic sheets too thick for the clips.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d70328f-8d61-4bc9-8903-00d8cb5a583f)

There are 2 LARGE clips and 2 SMALL clips

The locations of the LARGE clips have RED arrows 
BLUE arrows point to SMALL clips
