The inside of the mothbox has also been improved in version 4.0

There is only one laser cut mainboard, and it fits more securely inside the box.

There are 11 laser cut pieces you will assemble with electronics parts.

* Main board
* 4 clips attach to main board (2 wide 2 thin)
* 6 camera glare blocker circles

# Camera Glare Blocker
The function of the camera glare blocker is to set the camera a little bit in front of the super bright lights so that they don't cause a glare that interferes with the image quality.

## Assemble Camera Lens Glare Blocker
Take your six circles and stack them on top of each other.

{: .note }
> There is a small arrow with a dot at the top of each camera glare blocker circle. All the arrows should be lined up on top of each other.

![PXL_20240528_214804231](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/885e2b93-387a-4b99-97db-643c3f4a1909)

Place two zip ties through the side holes of the small glare blocker circles to connect all 6 circles together. 

![PXL_20240528_214758314](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/b44d4001-3a20-4970-92cd-68133f908384)

Finally, using two M2 screws, you can attach the Camera into place. You can use 4 screws if you really want, but 2 is sufficient.
![PXL_20240528_214812935](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/89230aff-adc9-4328-8fb4-aac0a06448c6)


## Attach Camera Glare Blocker to Mainboard
Using the two holes directly to the side of the vertical center holes at the top and bottom, secure the Camera Glare Blocker to the mainboard.

{: .note }
> The Camera Glare Blocker needs to be lined up correctly with the main board. You can use the small arrow to line it up with the mainboard. And the arrow also points to the Mothbox Logo.

# Ringlights
These two circular lights function to evenly illuminate the target area to get high quality images of the moths. We use these ring lights which are originally sold as inexpensive illuminators for microscopes. They are some of the cheapest and highest density bright LEDs we can find, and work well for taking photos of our moths.

## Prepare Ring Lights
![1000056735](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/74dedc06-9cac-48b0-a95c-d2e9a93ded6f)

Each mothbox ideally uses two ring lights to illuminate the target. If necessary though one ring light can be used and fit around the camera module.

We need to disassemble the ring lights before we can add them to our mothbox. This is so we can make them smaller and controllable.

Unfortunately found out that these ring lights come in two slightly different forms. And one the LEDs are longer than the others. And so we have slightly different build instructions for each.
![1000056739](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/eed1812a-ff1c-4ad6-8c1e-63b90c30cac5)

# Ring light (long Led Style)
To take apart these ring lights first you need to find the hidden screw. The screw is located underneath the sticker on the front.

Peel back the sticker and then unscrew the screw.
![1000056715](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/41fb74be-5ddd-4345-8320-5fc0087d1eee)
![1000056718](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/963e40c8-400c-4083-8016-82dec3c50f6b)


The front cover of the ring light should easily pop off now.
![1000056721](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/6e5529c9-5f16-4233-8026-f26ae4776633)

There's one screw left connected to the little circuit board inside the ring light.
Unscrew it and remove it.
![1000056723](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/5a252e0a-faa9-4687-8a61-7e5e6fd3bd46)

Now use some kind of thin tool or flat screwdriver to pry off the front of the ring light. 

![1000056725](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/5641466f-eb30-4dfc-a8b0-d096bd2c8361)
![1000056736](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/bbd83fbd-7199-444c-a392-d829fdeff9d6)
![1000056726](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/8e355324-5e54-4a0d-b219-23f3e65a5a77)

Finally there are two wires you need to snip that go to the  barrel jack. Snip them off, and remove the entire ring light electronics.

![1000056729](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/6a4bde56-2a23-467b-8522-1f193531e2ab)

## remove the knob
Turn the knob all the way clockwise. This sets it to max output.

Next pull the plastic knob straight off  this will prevent it from rotating later. If you are worried about it potentially rotating on its own you could also add a little bit of super glue to this potentiometer's metal knob to keep it in place, but this should be unnecessary.
![1000056740](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/2ef5664c-f44c-42af-a783-ff1cc7e40921)

Some of the knobs might be secured with a bit of glue. It's ok you can yank it straight off. You might need to use a tool as a kind of lever to pry the knob off.

![1000056731](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/e1bc261f-36cb-4072-97e4-4f5371c4b17e)

## Disassemble RingLight

## Connect Ringlight

### First Side
Feed the wires of the ringlight through the hole and position it flat against the mainboard.
![PXL_20240528_220841309](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/4f6cf390-ff8e-4120-af89-6f4546f5224c)

Add zipties in these two locations to secure it.
![PXL_20240528_220848536](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/7361216e-7226-4c31-bc23-418397c1125e)

One rightlight should be finished and attached like this!


![PXL_20240528_220852183](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/abac79cb-3ceb-478f-b910-7bbc837a81e8)

### Second Side
Place the second ring light with the wires towards the big open gap

![PXL_20240528_221239622](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/2f16ea18-048b-4787-a625-1ef429a1bd6d)
You can zip its wires in place to stop them from getting tangled in things and help protect them
![PXL_20240528_221257355](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/92ea5c0a-3e20-48d7-a837-731dcb4ba20e)

Add zipties through these two holes
![PXL_20240528_221243294](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/b241f36d-b417-4dda-8d66-3a8db11dbfd6)


# Connect the Raspberry Pi
It sits in the corner. The four holes it connects to are marked with an extra tiny hole so you know which holes to line up.
![image](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/b8fccf42-da9d-4776-9406-c5989ae9c8a8)

![image](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/fffef7b3-921b-49cc-8629-786a10ecbf41)


We will only connect 3 of the holes of the Raspberry Pi, because one is hidden behind the ringlight. (If you wish to connect the 4th hole, make sure to use a plastic bolt.)


Add three of the spacers on top of the Pi's holes like this.
![image](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/05b1540c-ab99-4aa9-9acb-91b6bbcc82f7)

Screw them in from the other side
![PXL_20240528_221455180](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/1eea97a5-2d5c-49d1-970c-071a9e4d9f7c)

## Connect the RTC battery
Make sure to plug the battery into the Pi5's little battery slot. This battery keeps the clock accurate even if the pi loses power.
![PXL_20240528_221654951](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/7b368f8d-57c8-43cb-b7c4-463ab8504b19)


# Trim Your Zip ties
Now is a good time to trim up the ends of the zip ties you have sticking around
![PXL_20240528_221836961](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/b8328173-9122-4dd3-b99b-1df50e9d9fef)

# Connect the camera cable to the Raspberry Pi
Connect the ribbon cable to the raspberry pi
if you are using a Pi5, make sure to connect to the first slot labeled "Cam0"
![PXL_20240528_231930368](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/f4a7a9ed-f9fc-4d4a-a23b-6be467ee18d4)

# Attach Relay hat to Pi
You will now connect the sockets on the relay hat to all the shiny metal pins sticking out of the pi.
First move the camera ribbon cable to the side of the bolt sticking out of the pi
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f082ca1-ee8c-4688-bc48-480ec85297f6)

Place the relay hat on top of the Pi. Line up the GPIO pins, and press softly down.

## Tape the RTC battery on top of the relays

This is just to keep it out of the way. and to stop it from getting tangled.

Attach a piece of double sided tape to the little battery.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77edf203-c352-4862-b33e-d91cd66cfc32)

{: .note }
> This image kinda looks like there are too many fingers.

stick it on top of the relay.

{: .important }
> Don't block the screw holes on top of the relay.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b669fba1-ea48-4d0b-b80c-711225a3045b)

# Connect the Battery

Unscrew these three screws from the bottom of your Battery
![image](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/a54fb25a-e785-4e21-a92b-25b139c71ca9)
save the screws.

{: .important } 
> Make sure to press down firmly when unscrewing the screws so you do not strip the heads.

Now screw the screws back in, connecting the battery to the mainboard.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d443341-2b62-4a2f-be2c-140cb7a30071)

# Add the Clips to Mainboard
Now you can attach all the little plastic standoff clips to the edges of the mainboard. These hold the mothbox electronics firmly in place inside the plastic box.

{: .note } 
> If your mainboard still has protective plastic, you might need to peel it off from the mainboard before attaching the clips. Sometimes the protective plastic makes the acrylic sheets too thick for the clips.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d70328f-8d61-4bc9-8903-00d8cb5a583f)

There are 2 LARGE clips and 2 SMALL clips

The locations of the LARGE clips have RED arrows 
BLUE arrows point to SMALL clips
