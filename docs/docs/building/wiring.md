Finally we will make all the electrical connections to make our Mothbox work! There is no soldering required, just lever nut connectors and wire strippers.
We worked hard to keep the electronics as simple as possible so many people will be able to build this. There may be more "elegant" ways of connecting everything together, but we tried to make a wiring style as easy to understand as possible. 

Follow along and fear not!

# Overview
Here's a temporary diagram

# Start from the Battery Output






# Add charging port
a nice waterproof charging port will make it much easier to use the mothbox! It's not too difficult to add either!

You need a plug and a socket DC barrel jack cables. And you can also use a inline lever nut to connect them.

Mark your spot for the port. You can use a marker to note the spot. Though right between the big gap between the flanges is a good spot. You might notice my pen mark is a bit to the left. That works, but actually around where i put the red dot should be easier.

Drill a hole. Our socket is a little over 3/8 in in diameter, so i used a 3/8 in drill bit to make a hole, and then wiggled it around a bit to make it large enough to fit.

You can use a razor blade to remove any burrs from the edges of the hole you made.

Slide the socket into place. The rubber stopper and gasket should be on the outside, and the metal washer and nut should come on the inside after it. Tighten it well.

If you are really paranoid about moisture, you can hot glue or silicone around your port to make it extra secure.

## Wiring
use an inline lever nut to connect the socket to the plug

Now you can connect the plug to the IN port of your battery.

Try it out, your battery should charge now when it is connected to the external port.

When you aren't charging it, you can put the rubber cap over the port to protect it from moisture.

Hooray, your charging port should be all set!

# Test everything
You should now be able to put an [SD card with a latest image]()
