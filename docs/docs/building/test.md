# Connect to Battery
Now is the big moment to see if everything works! You can connect the plug to the OUT port of the battery,

and also plug a USB cable into the raspberry pi and connect it to the battery's USB port.

When you flip the battery's switch to "on", everything should turn on!
![PXL_20240620_150447777](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/733881f7-a3d0-4b95-9e71-31fe0f7f33eb)

At first just the little LEDs on the Pi and the Relay will turn on.

# First Boot Up
The first time a Mothbox boots up with a fresh SD card, it will take a lot longer to start up than normal. It has to do all kinds of prep things inside the SD card that take up time on the first launch. It will often shut itself down after it does a first launch. So the first time it gets powered, just wait 10 minutes. If it doesn't turn on after that, restart the power and it should start up soon.


# Second Boot Up
Sometimes the Mothbox will automatically launch the very first time you turn it on, but again, don't worry if not. Just wait 10 minutes and restart it if it hasn't started.

On the second boot, after a minute or so, the operating system will have loaded up, and the whole device should go into "Mothbox Mode," turning on the UV attractor and flashing the Ring Lights every minute.

If something is not lighting up, check your connections you wired up!

If everything is looking good, it's time to start [USING YOUR MOTHBOX](https://digital-naturalism-laboratories.github.io/Mothbox/docs/usage/basic/)
