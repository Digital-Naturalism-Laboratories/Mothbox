# Arms 
Simply laser cut the dxf files out of clear acrylic (this helps give more surface area to your target). If needed you could use an opaque material.

{: .note }
> Each arm of the mothbox is made from 2 arms. This is for strength as well as redundancy. If one arm breaks in the field, you already have a backup!
