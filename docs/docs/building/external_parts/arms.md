# Arms 
Simply laser cut the dxf files out of clear acrylic (this helps give more surface area to your target). If needed you could use an opaque material.

{: .note }
> Each arm of the mothbox is made from 2 arms. This is for strength as well as redundancy. If one arm breaks in the field, you already have a backup!


# Peel the Plastic
Pull the protective plastic off the arms.

# Attaching Arms

## Off-the-shelf Case
Use 1/4in bolts to connect the arms to the box

## 3D Printed Case
With the 3D printed case you have multiple options for connecting the arms!

You can use 1/4 in bolts like before.

You can use re-usable cable ties.

Or, my favorite, is to use rubbery re-usuable ties.
