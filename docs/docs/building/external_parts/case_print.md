(Section coming soon!)

The lastest version of the Mothbox has a 3D printable case! We have been testing it fiercely in the jungles of Panama, and it's held up wonderfully!

We have been using inexpensive PETG-Carbon Fiber filament ($~30 USD for 2kg - Eryone brand), drying it for 12 hours, and then printing.
