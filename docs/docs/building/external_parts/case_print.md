(Full Section coming soon!)

The lastest version of the Mothbox has a 3D printable case! We have been testing it fiercely in the wettest part of the wet season for months in jungles of Panama, and it's held up wonderfully! Nice and dry, easy to use, minimal manual labor! Plus it's cheaper than buying and hacking your own case!



# Parts

* Main Filament - 850 grams
* TPU Rubber Filament - (Optional for better waterproofing, not really needed in dry places) - 100 grams
* Clear Acrylic - For the front window
* #6x3/8in screws - (not super exacting, near equivalents work too!)
* Cable Ties - Ideally reusable zip ties, or silicone straps, or our [TPU printable ties we made ourselves](https://www.printables.com/model/1530721-reusable-rubber-cable-tie)!


# Filament Suggestions

**PETG-CF**
We have been using inexpensive PETG-Carbon Fiber filament ($~16 USD for 1kg - Eryone brand), drying it for 12 hours, and then printing. 

**TPU**
For the 3D printed TPU rubber, we have been using Bambu lab 85a
