(Full Section coming soon!)

The lastest version of the Mothbox has a 3D printable case! We have been testing it fiercely in the wettest part of the wet season for months in jungles of Panama, and it's held up wonderfully! Nice and dry, easy to use, minimal manual labor! Plus it's cheaper than buying and hacking your own case!

# Parts

* Main Filament - 850 grams
* TPU Rubber Filament - (Optional for better waterproofing, not really needed in dry places) - 100 grams
* Clear Acrylic - For the front window
* #6x3/8in screws - (not super exacting, near equivalents work too!)
* Cable Ties - Ideally reusable zip ties, or silicone straps, or our [TPU printable ties we made ourselves](https://www.printables.com/model/1530721-reusable-rubber-cable-tie)!


# Filament Suggestions

**PETG-CF**
We have been using inexpensive PETG-Carbon Fiber filament ($~16 USD for 1kg - Eryone brand), drying it for 12 hours, and then printing. 

**TPU**
For the 3D printed TPU rubber, we have been using Bambu lab 85a

# Print all the Parts
All the parts are located in the [Github Repo](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/tree/main/Hardware/Case/Mothbox_Pro). Download them all and print them out. There is even a 3MF file that has all the parts laid out for you to print in a slicer like Bambu Studio.
The list of parts is as follows along with what material to make them in.

* Outer Shell - PETG-CF
* Inner Chassis - PETG-CF
* Glare Blocker - PETG-CF
* Back Lid - PETG-CF
* Front Lid - PETG-CF (material doesn't really matter- just a cover)
* Front Gasket - TPU (Optional seal for wet climates)
* Back Gasket - TPU
* Plexi Front - Laser Cut Clear Acrylic

# Assemble the Case
## Front Lid
Peel off any protective plastic from your clear acrylic.

Put the acrylic on top of that. It make take a little pressure to pop in. Make sure the holes line up correctly.

Screw the front plexi to the case. Only screw until the screw is snug. Don't overtighten or you may crack the plexi.
