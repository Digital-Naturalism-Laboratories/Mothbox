# Connect Mothbeams to Mainboard

The Mothbeams are made to pop right onto the mainboard of the Mothbox! There's some things you can adjust first though!

## Configure Mothbeams

### Power
The mothbeams allow you to set how powerful they are with little switches. The more switches you turn on, the brighter they will be, but they will also run through your battery faster! The first two switches add 70mA for each switch. The second two switches add 150mA for each switch.

Remove the protective sticker over the switches.

Switch your desired switches (I usually use a tool or bit of wire to flip the tiny switches)
<img width="1225" height="919" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75f07c83-0185-41bb-a192-561d7b1f6ee1" />


I usually switch the first two switches (+140mA), and this is QUITE BRIGHT. You probably want to switch at least the first 70mA switch on, but I wouldn't reccomend 3+ switches unless you really really need it to be exceptionally bright! (Or power and heat are not a problem for your setup).

### UV and Visible
You can also decide which mothbeams to connect. The board can support up to 3. These can all be UV, all Visible, or a mixture. You can control each of the 3 Attractors individually too, so this can be used for experiments between different wavelengths of light!

### (Optional) Reinforce Connector
Because of how metal PCBs are designed, the connectors cannot go all the way through the board. Instead you can see that the connector part is just soldered to the surface. This means it can be a bit weaker mechanically. If you are just connecting your mothbeam to your mainboard, you are probably fine as these parts will not move around much. But if you are using them for something else (like a standalone mothbeam), you might want to reinforce the connector with just a little hot glue.

## Connect Mothbeams
Now that your Mothbeam is setup, you can just pop them on! Connect it to the top layer of the right angle pins sticking out (the bottom pins are just for spacing and aren't connected to anything).
<img width="1225" height="919" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a123834-9e3a-4120-bf49-deac2175c570" />

### Lock in with a Zip Nut
Now for each mothbeam, you will need two thin cable ties. 
<img width="689" height="919" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/314c267f-5d4e-4766-920e-370134ae93c4" />
Push one through the hole on the mothbeam and pull it all the way through.

now add the second zip tie to the back that will lock it in place!
This will keep it from going anywhere.
<img width="682" height="382" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12908937-b14b-4299-b106-57f868e5416d" />
Trim the dangly ends off the ties, and repeat for the other mothbeams!
<img width="666" height="498" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22a289c2-cbcc-48a0-8b89-8aab1bcc1fc6" />

Now all your Mothbeams should be connected!
<img width="604" height="737" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30b895cb-ef28-41c6-9481-3d9ce8578ce4" />


# Connect Camera to Mainboard

## Prepare Camera
The Arducam comes in a little box with one WHITE cable and one BROWN cable. 
<img width="918" height="689" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/253e3acf-e0df-4ffd-853b-f63fcc3c409c" />

The white cable is, unfortunately, usually the one attached, and it is for older computers. We will swap it for the brown one!

First, you can take the little plastic protector off the front of the camera:
<img width="695" height="926" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f6a0867-3acd-425b-90ff-e06b29cb8aa4" />
<img width="695" height="926" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68f1acbf-2034-43f3-87d9-0d4de5e1ec38" />

Next, use the ends of a small screwdriver or tweezers to slide the camera cable lock. You just need to budge it a little bit.
<img width="695" height="926" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4689c06e-72a6-4842-aff8-329edefee6ef" />
The white cable should slide free easily now!

Now you will connect the brown cable. Make sure the black side of the end is facing the back of the camera like this:

<img width="695" height="926" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87f11ef0-5eeb-4e76-8032-b15e9d771ef4" />

Slide the cable in firmly, and then use your tool to snugly lock down the camera connector lock. Sometimes you need to press one side and then the other.
<img width="695" height="926" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/288f765d-5c3a-45d0-9dde-c3f0f64ffa06" />
Give the cable a light tug to make sure it is securely connected.

## Camera to Board
With its brown cable attached, position the camera on the front of the board so the cable lines up with the slot for it.
<img width="695" height="926" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56293a69-e106-4a82-88eb-b288b8794b6f" />
Note how the holes line up:
<img width="918" height="689" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb0c2e7a-b3f5-48d2-992c-4ff0e2e4652d" />

Position the glare blocker over the camera and again make sure all the holes line up.

<img width="695" height="926" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f8d674d-c95c-4ac8-9df4-894bcb8c6a79" />

Now you will add some thin cable ties to two holes in the glare blocker.
<img width="695" height="926" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6fff474-b47d-4aa7-a324-2a9a9326e84a" />

Make them go through the mainboard, out the back, and back to the front of the mainboard.
<img width="918" height="689" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3520c366-43dc-48cc-8b6f-d41c7d5ae36e" />
<img width="695" height="926" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb78c94d-cabc-4aee-95a8-3e842c53dae1" />

Now get two more cable ties and secure the camera module down.
<img width="695" height="926" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2613657-0e5d-44d8-b276-6ff5b81b09d6" />

 Tighten it up, and trim the dangly bits.
 <img width="695" height="926" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a05ac2ec-f2b9-408c-a63a-fcf760854502" />


# Connect the Pi

## SD
First put your SD card [(Flashed with the Mothbox software on it)](https://digital-naturalism-laboratories.github.io/Mothbox/docs/usage/initialsetup/#flash-firmware) into your Pi.
<img width="918" height="689" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64788b6e-e86a-4509-bc33-5fd064c36fd8" />

## Connect Camera

Lift the connect flap on CAM port 0 on the Pi
<img width="567" height="804" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5db33dad-7b9b-4b3e-a54e-b410a75ccf4e" />

I use a fingernail for this.
<img width="695" height="926" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5197f3b-5512-45e2-9f98-dfa2bd9c071f" />

The black side of the brown camera cable needs to face the side of the PI that the SD card is in.
<img width="695" height="926" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee4ae7da-e233-432c-812f-fcc1622b688d" />

Slide the cable in, and firmly press down the camera cable closer to make a snug connection.

<img width="695" height="926" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0efcdb4-5145-49a9-8de8-b59d4d165f59" />

## Connect Pi to Mainboard
We made our own fun connection to hold the raspberry pi. It's a bit novel, but it pops in and holds it securely.

Line up your Pi pins with the socket like this:
<img width="695" height="926" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91cfc6a3-d4b2-4ff1-98b3-cc1920895c13" />

You will need to tilt the Pi at a slight angle as you first press it in. Then it will straighten out and slide right into its slot.
<img width="695" height="926" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2692e3a8-02d7-4044-8096-dfd6f1a1bf52" />
<img width="695" height="926" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ce986e4-a558-46ca-8d00-4c7caa3a4d31" />

Congratulate Yourself! You got most of your Mothbox's electronics connected!
