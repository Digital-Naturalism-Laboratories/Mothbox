# Connect Mothbeams to Mainboard

The Mothbeams are made to pop right onto the mainboard of the Mothbox! There's some things you can adjust first though!

## Configure Mothbeams

### Power
The mothbeams allow you to set how powerful they are with little switches. The more switches you turn on, the brighter they will be, but they will also run through your battery faster! The first two switches add 70mA for each switch. The second two switches add 150mA for each switch.

Remove the protective sticker over the switches.

Switch your desired switches (I usually use a tool or bit of wire to flip the tiny switches)

I usually switch the first two switches (+140mA), and this is QUITE BRIGHT. You probably want to switch at least the first 70mA switch on, but I wouldn't reccomend 3+ switches unless you really really need it to be exceptionally bright! (Or power and heat are not a problem for your setup).

### UV and Visible
You can also decide which mothbeams to connect. The board can support up to 3. These can all be UV, all Visible, or a mixture. You can control each of the 3 Attractors individually too, so this can be used for experiments between different wavelengths of light!

### (Optional) Reinforce Connector
Because of how metal PCBs are designed, the connectors cannot go all the way through the board. Instead you can see that the connector part is just soldered to the surface. This means it can be a bit weaker mechanically. If you are just connecting your mothbeam to your mainboard, you are probably fine as these parts will not move around much. But if you are using them for something else (like a standalone mothbeam), you might want to reinforce the connector with just a little hot glue.

## Connect Mothbeams
Now that your Mothbeam is setup, you can just pop them on! Connect it to the top layer of the right angle pins sticking out (the bottom pins are just for spacing and aren't connected to anything).

### Lock in with a Zip Nut
Now for each mothbeam, you will need two thin cable ties.

Push one through the hole on the mothbeam and pull it all the way through.

now add the second zip tie to the back that will lock it in place!
This will keep it from going anywhere.

Trim the dangly ends off the ties, and repeat for the other mothbeams!

Now all your Mothbeams should be connected!
