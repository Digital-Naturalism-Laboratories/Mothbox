To build a Mothbox Pro, you will need these parts:

* Mothbox Mainboard - a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) with most electronics already connected up for you! - $50
* Mothbeam Boards - Little, super bright, metal LEDs that plug in to your Mainboard (up to 3) - $5 each
* Raspberry Pi 5 4GB (or higher) - $75
* SD Card - 32GB or bigger, Class A1 or faster (A2 is nice) - $15
* Pi 5 RTC Battery - $8
* Talentcell PB1202b - You can actually use any battery between 9-36 V to power the mothbox (it's more efficient around 12V), but for these tutorials we will use the main battery we use for all our devices, this one by Talentcell $80
* 9-36V to 12V voltage Regulator - $15
* Arducam 64 MP Owlsight camera - $55 (Don't get the "Hawkeye" older version of this camera if you can avoid it!)
