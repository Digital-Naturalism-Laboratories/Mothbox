# Battery - Talentcell PB1202b 12v
The Mothbox is set up to run off 9-36V DC batteries of any sort! So you can hook up car batteries, old motorcycle batteries, solar panel boat batteries, generally whatever you need! The DC regulators we use tend to be most efficient around 12V, and so we tend to use a 12V one, but the circuits should be flexible!

For the purpose of this tutorial, we will show you how to use the cheapest, most power dense battery we have found that you can still take on commercial planes around the world. That's the 12V talentcell batteries.
These batteries can also be daisy chained together (if they are both fully charged already) so you can double the life of your device easily! (They have to charge separately)

You will also be using as 9-36V 5a 12V regulator. This ensures constant brightness of the lights over the discharge rate of different batteries. We could have built this circuitry directly into the Mothbox PCB, but after years of field trials we found that if electronics due fail after many months of use, it's almost always the voltage regulator that fails (Also we haven't had any failures since we started using this version that has a big metal heatsink!). So we made the design decision to have this cheap ($15) ubiquitous part be replaceable, so if it does fail, you don't have to replace the entire board!

# Prep the Regulator
The regulators tend to ship with short little wire leads. Trim the ends off.

# Attach Battery and Regulator to Board

## Regulator Strap
First take one long cable tie, and pass it through this hole (so the head of that tie is stopped by the hole on the other side).

Now set the battery with the text facing up and the heatsink on top it like this. You will pass that cable tie over the regulator and through the hole at the bottom of the board.

Then lock that tie down with another tie on the outside.

## Horizontal Strap
Now you will take a new zip tie up through the hole at the bottom near the cutout. It will pass in front of the battery and between the wires coming out the regulator. it will go up and over the regulator.

Your cable tie will probably not be long enough to go over the whole length of the battery, so just attach another one to it and pass it through the hole at the battery's butt end.

Then secure this strap from the other side with another tie locking it on.

## Back Strap
There's one more strap to hold this battery firmly in place. Add zip ties from these bottom holes.

Once, again, lock it in with a zip tie on the other side.

# Trim Straps
Tighten up all your straps really well. Then snip off all the dangly parts!
