The Mothbox Pro is our Mothbox designed for manufacturing scalability. The key difference is that we designed an Open Source PCB that can be industrially manufactured for cheaper than buying all the parts needed for a Mothbox DIY. The PCB also has some bonus features like physical switches, light sensors, and more!
