# Determine your Case

You now have two options for housing your Mothbox Pro.

## Off the Shelf
It's compatible with the old hacked Plano fishing box case. 
You can follow instructions for [how to build an off-the-shelf case here](https://digital-naturalism-laboratories.github.io/Mothbox/docs/building/external_parts/case_ots/).

## 3D Print

Better yet, though, you can now 3D print your own cases even cheaper and easier! Follow the instructions for [making a 3D printed case here](https://digital-naturalism-laboratories.github.io/Mothbox/docs/building/external_parts/case_print/).

# Screw PCB to Chassis
Using #6 x 3/8in long screws (doesn't have to be super exact, something about that size will work), attach the PCB to the inner chassis.
