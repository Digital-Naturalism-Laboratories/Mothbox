Our Mothbox electronics are together, but now we probably need to give it a housing to protect it!

# Determine your Case

You now have two options for housing your Mothbox Pro.

## Off the Shelf
It's compatible with the old hacked Plano fishing box case. 
You can follow instructions for [how to build an off-the-shelf case here](https://digital-naturalism-laboratories.github.io/Mothbox/docs/building/external_parts/case_ots/).

## 3D Print

Better yet, though, you can now 3D print your own cases even cheaper and easier! Follow the instructions for [making a 3D printed case here](https://digital-naturalism-laboratories.github.io/Mothbox/docs/building/external_parts/case_print/).

**The following instructions will be for the 3D printed case option.**

# Prep Chassis
First we need to snip this tiny support piece off the chassis. This section is just there to make printing easier, and we need to remove it so it doesn't get blocked by the case's plugs.

# Screw PCB to Chassis
Place the Mothbox electronics into the chassis.

Make sure the indent in the PCB lines up with the cutout at the bottom of the chassis.

Using #6 x 3/8in long screws (doesn't have to be super exact, something about that size will work), attach the PCB to the inner chassis.

There are 4 holes in the 4 corners of the board. Simply screw them snugly into place.

Everything should feel secure inside this little removable box now!

# Load Chassis into Shell

Slide the chassis with the electronics into the back of the case. Make sure the battery area is towards the bottom where the wires from the external sockets are.

## Connect the External Charger
Remember that wire connected to the lever nut that wasn't connected to anything? Now it's time to connect it! 

Get the two wire ends from the external charger port and put them into that lever nut. Make sure the black is going to the black and red to the red.

You can double check that your wiring is good by plugging the external charger  into the bottom of the box and seeing if the light on the charger changes to red (indicating it's charging).

## Connect the External Attractor Port (Optional)
You can hook up your external attractor port to the PCB quite easily.

Take the two ends from the external attractor port, and connect them to the socket box on the back left of the PCB labeled "external attractor"

Make sure 
* the black wire goes to a negative "-" port
* the red wire goes to a positive "+" port

# Connect Back Lid
Your Mothbox should be fully functional now!

You can close it up now by putting the back lid on. 
You can use a variety of closures to attach the lid:

* 1/4 in bolts and nuts
* Reusuable zip ties
* or (my favorite) rubbery silicone ties

Congrats on your Mothbox!
