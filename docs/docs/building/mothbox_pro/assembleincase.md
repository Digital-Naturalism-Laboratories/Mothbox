Our Mothbox electronics are together, but now we probably need to give it a housing to protect it!

# Determine your Case

You now have two options for housing your Mothbox Pro.

## Off the Shelf
It's compatible with the old hacked Plano fishing box case. 
You can follow instructions for [how to build an off-the-shelf case here](https://digital-naturalism-laboratories.github.io/Mothbox/docs/building/external_parts/case_ots/).

## 3D Print

Better yet, though, you can now 3D print your own cases even cheaper and easier! Follow the instructions for [making a 3D printed case here](https://digital-naturalism-laboratories.github.io/Mothbox/docs/building/external_parts/case_print/).

**The following instructions will be for the 3D printed case option.**

# Prep Chassis
First we need to snip this tiny support piece off the chassis. This section is just there to make printing easier, and we need to remove it so it doesn't get blocked by the case's plugs.

# Screw PCB to Chassis
Place the Mothbox electronics into the chassis.

Make sure the indent in the PCB lines up with the cutout at the bottom of the chassis.

Using #6 x 3/8in long screws (doesn't have to be super exact, something about that size will work), attach the PCB to the inner chassis.

There are 4 holes in the 4 corners of the board. Simply screw them snugly into place.

Everything should feel secure inside this little removable box now!
