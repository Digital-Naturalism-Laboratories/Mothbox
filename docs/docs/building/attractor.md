The next step may vary from Mothbox to Mothbox. It's about choosing what type of light (or in the future maybe chemical?) based attractor you want to use. We are still experimenting with the most cost efficient and effective LEDs one can find, but luckily the openness of the mothbox design lets us be flexible and have many options.

There are three basic options for your attractor

#  Internal Mothbeam

# Internal 12V UV Light
You can purchase 12V UV LEDs easily with many commercially available options. Often many will be too large to fit inside the Mothbox, BUT most of the design of these devices is just a large metal case that works as a heatsink. If you take them apart, you will often find the actualy 12V LED is just a thin part.

for instance

these [inexpensive 10W flood lights](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LT53312/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

unscrew very easily and consist of just a simple circuit board connected with thermal glue to the metal case. You can take these apart, and using thermal silicone double sided tape (and maybe a little extra glue or screws) connect these UV leds to a piece of metal mounted inside the mothbox like with the method described above for an Internal Mothbeam.

# External 12V UV Light

Using the [same method for adding an additional charging port](https://digital-naturalism-laboratories.github.io/Mothbox/docs/building/wiring/#add-charging-port-optional-but-nice) we described earlier, you can add an additional OUTPUT port to the bottom of your mothbox. This new external port should be connected to the same relay as you would hook up any of the attractor options. Then you can simply use a DC cable to connect whatever 12 V light you wish to use outside of the mothbox.

For instance these [inexpensive 10W flood lights](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LT53312/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) 
![PXL_20240625_214150615](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/dcb9633a-840a-45e2-9c1b-f5d94a2c536a)

are 12V powered and are semi waterproofed and could be connected externally.
