There's many ways to use your Mothbox! The Mothbox's default state will automatically calibrate its focus and exposure to whatever kind of target is positioned in front of it. The main thing is that it should probably be 
* white
* flat
* easy for insects to perch on


We share four main options for your target:

The Standard Target is the most compact surface for the Mothbox. It also can be lit up quite easily from lights inside the mothbox.

The Dual Target doesn't require any additional materials other than cutting an extra Target shape.

# Standard Target
Building the targets are mostly straightforward. You just glue the target material to the target. Using a spray adhesive tends to work well.

1. Spray one side of your target material with glue.
2. Make sure the protective plastic is peeled off the acrylic target
3. lay the target material on top of the side of the target with the inverted logo. (you are covering up the logo)
4. lay some heavy flat things on top of the target (to help make it extra flat)
5. Let dry for a couple hours
