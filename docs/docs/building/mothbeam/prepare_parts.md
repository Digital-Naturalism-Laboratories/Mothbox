# Prepare Heatsink

You will either need to find a 15cm length of aluminum, or cut a piece yourself.

If you need to cut it, wear safety goggles and use a hacksaw or jigsaw with metal blade.

After it has been cut, make sure to let it cool, the fresh part can be quite hot!

Debur any metal bits on the edge. Remove any protective plastic.

# Prepare Acrylic Tube

You need a 10cm acrylic tube with a 6.5cm diameter (none of these measurements need to be too exact).

Generally you will find acrylic tubes in longer lengths you need to cut.

Use a plastic blade on a saw and cut off your tube.

# Laser cut end caps
You can use the designs to laser cut end caps for your acrylic tube. If you are using a different metal rod, you can always change the cutout to the profile of whatever rod you use!

If you want to be really fancy, after you etch the text, you can spray paint your acrylic (if it still has the protective plastic on it).
