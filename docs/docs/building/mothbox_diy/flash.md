# Flash the Raspberry Pi Image onto an SD Card
Download the [latest Mothbox Image](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o3aGB1MZUrNxRoGycFVw_ofUQehrjuqF?usp=sharing) to your computer. You may need an [unzipping software like 7zip](https://7-zip.org/download.html) to unzip the image after you download it.

Download Software to flash the the Image. You can use the traditional [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), or I often use [Win32DiskImager](https://win32diskimager.org/).

Get an SD card (at least 16GB). Connect it to your computer.

Start the Imaging software.

If you are using Raspberry Pi Imager, click "Choose OS." Then scroll all the way down to choose "Use Custom."
Click "Choose Storage" and choose the SD card you have connected.
Click "Next."

If it asks you to apply customization options, just click no. 

Now it will start flashing your SD card. This should take about 5-10 mins.
