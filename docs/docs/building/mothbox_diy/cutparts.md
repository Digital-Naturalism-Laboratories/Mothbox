The new v4 version of the mothbox has a more efficient design, and all the acrylic parts can be cut from one 50x60cm piece of acrylic.

# Acrylic
In the [Github, there are files for all the parts you need to cut.](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/tree/main/Hardware/Case/MothboxDIY/Laser%20Cutting%20Layouts/v4)
You can use the dxf files, or we even made layouts of many of the components in lightburn files for you. There is even a [file of "all acrylic parts"](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/blob/main/Hardware/Case/MothboxDIY/Laser%20Cutting%20Layouts/Laser%20Cutting%20Layouts/v4/AllAcrylicPartsInOne.lbrn2) that you could cut in one go on many standard laser cutters.


Cut all these parts out of 3mm acrylic.

The cam glare blockers should be cut out of OPAQUE acrylic if possible (or you can spraypaint them black if needed).

The arms should be cut out of CLEAR, UNCOLORED acrylic if possible. 

Otherwise, the colors don't really matter.

# Felt
The only other part to cut out is the felt cover for the target. Find some white acrylic felt and cut out the file that says "Target Material."
Acrylic felt cuts really easily and cleanly in the laser cutter.
