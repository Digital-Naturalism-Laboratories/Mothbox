The exact specifications of the mothbox may change depending on factors like which microcontroller or power source you choose.

## Physical Size
* Weight: 2750 grams
* Size: 11"L x 7"W x 4"H (box)
* Target Sizes
  * Standard: 29cm x 20.5cm
  * Dual: 41cm x 29cm
  * Quad XL: 54cm x 41cm


## Cost

* Approximate cost: $375
* Off-the-shelf parts.

## Power

* Battery: Talentcell PB120B1 - 12V Lithium ion, Rechargeable 142.08Wh 38400mAh
* [Additional Power Inputs](https://digital-naturalism-laboratories.github.io/Mothbox/docs/building/powersources/):
  * Solar (up to 18V 60 watts),
  * Extra Batteries
    * can [daisy chain up to 3 Talentcell PB120B1 batteries](https://digital-naturalism-laboratories.github.io/Mothbox/docs/building/powersources/#build-a-waterproof-battery-pack)
    * or connect other DC batteries (like a car battery)
  * continuous DC power (can plug into a wall if near a power grid)
* Sleep time: 6 months
* Runtime: 21 hours continuous (1 minute photography intervals with internal mothbeam)
  * About 85% of the power goes to the UV attractor connected. Lower power UV lights can last longer, higher power lights will reduce its runtime
  * Our standard schedule has 5 hours of runtime per night, which means a normal Mothbox can run for 4 nights before recharging.

## Imagery
* Camera: Arducam 64mp Owlsight OV64A40
* Image resolution: 9152Ã—6944 (Pi5)  9000x6000 (Pi4)
* Lens Adapter size: 55mm

## Weatherproofing
* Fully harsh weather resistant. Has been left outside for >1 month in the rainforest.
* Probably not submergable (don't use mothbox underwater, yet)

## Microcontroller  
* Microcontroller: Raspberry Pi5 (or Pi4 with Pijuice)
