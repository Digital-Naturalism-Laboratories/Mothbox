From its inception, the Mothbox was (and always will be) a fully open hardware and software project that anyone is free to use and build or modify themselves. Its core development was made possible through much volunteer work by Digital Naturalism Laboratories. Its continued development has been made possible througha series of small to large grants from different organizations.

# Inspiration
Hubert's initial inspiration came from a paper by [Bjerge et al, "An Automated Light Trap
to Monitor Moths (Lepidoptera)
Using Computer Vision-Based
Tracking and Deep Learning." *Sensors*
2021](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TweP9fMVRzXd51A6yHtfUynRnI5pbyCh/view?usp=sharing) .  We sought to make a robust DIY version that would be easy to use and function in the harsh tropics.

**$3,000 USD**

One of the first sponsorships this project recieved was from [Earthshot Labs](https://www.earthshot.eco/) who had briefly hired Hubert to help design a way to do multi-modal biodiversity assays of the reforestation project in the Azuero Penninsula in Panama.
They gave Dinalab ~$3000 USD to purchase parts and work on designing an automated insect monitoring system.

We made a fully functional prototype that held lots of promise (and also exposed us to the many design difficulties that would be encountered by such a project.)
This first version used a Raspberry pi, some relays, a large ring light, some $6 USB black light bars, and some tupperware.
