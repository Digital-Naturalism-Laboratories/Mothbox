From its inception, the Mothbox was (and always will be) a fully open hardware and software project that anyone is free to use and build or modify themselves. Its core development was made possible through much volunteer work by Digital Naturalism Laboratories. Its continued development has been made possible througha series of small to large grants from different organizations.

# Inspiration
Hubert's initial inspiration came from a paper by [Bjerge et al, "An Automated Light Trap
to Monitor Moths (Lepidoptera)
Using Computer Vision-Based
Tracking and Deep Learning." *Sensors*
2021](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TweP9fMVRzXd51A6yHtfUynRnI5pbyCh/view?usp=sharing) .  We sought to make a robust DIY version that would be easy to use and function in the harsh tropics.

**$3,000 USD**

One of the first sponsorships this project recieved was from [Earthshot Labs](https://www.earthshot.eco/) who had briefly hired Hubert to help design a way to do multi-modal biodiversity assays of the reforestation project in the Azuero Penninsula in Panama.
They gave Dinalab ~$3000 USD to purchase parts and work on designing an automated insect monitoring system.

We made a fully functional prototype that held lots of promise (and also exposed us to the many design difficulties that would be encountered by such a project.)
This first version used a Raspberry pi, some relays, a large ring light, some $6 USB black light bars, and some tupperware.

It functioned and took high resolution photos of nocturnal insects.

# V2
*2023 Q2*

**$3,000 USD**

Despite Earthshot labs going defunct in early 2023, the success of our first prototype drew the attention of Phoebe Zarnetske's group from Michigan State University. They were working on automated devices for insect monitoring for the Xprize competition in Singapore, 2023. They hired dinalab again for about 3K to purchase parts and design a new version that was meant to be deployed by a drone. This meant we had to design the project to be much much more compact and durable.

It featured a clear box design with as many internally shielded parts as possible along with a backlit board.

It allowed us to test out a variety of UV attracting Lights and ways of lighting the subjects.

It also started showing us just some of the power of this device, when, on one of our deployments in Azuero, it attracted a praying mantis that scientists on iNaturalist noted is an undescribed species!
