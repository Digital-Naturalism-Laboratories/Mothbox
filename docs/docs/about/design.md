# Simple Flat Design

The mothbox is designed so that all parts can be cut from flat planar material. It is more difficult to design a complex 3D electronic device using only 2 dimensional pieces, but there are several reasons for choosing this approach.


## Cross-Compatibility with multiple manufacturing techniques
Objects that are designed flat can be used in a wide variety of manufacturing techniques. Objects that are designed to be 3D printed generally can only be reproduced by 3D printers.
Instead these devices can be Laser cut, water-jet cut, CNC milled, 3D printed, cast, or even printed onto paper, traced, and manually cut out of something like 3mm plywood. Fully 3D objects intended to be 3D printed can be dif

## Speed of manufacturing
Flat parts can also be rapidly quickly. An entire mothbox can be laser cut in under 20 minutes, whereas a 3D printed version could take several hours. This is especially important to us as the designers since we are rapidly changing around the design to hone its abilities as a field instrument.
