# Development Team

The Mothbox was originally developed by a core team of Andy Quitmeyer, Hubert Szczgiel, and Kitty Quitmeyer

* Andy Quitmeyer

Dr. Andy Quitmeyer designs new ways to interact with the natural world. Quitmeyer has worked with large organizations like Cartoon Network, IDEO, and the Smithsonian, taught as a tenure-track professor, and even had his research turned into a (silly) television series called â€œHacking the Wild." distributed by Discovery Networks.

He spends most of his time volunteering with smaller organizations and communities, and co-founded the field-station/makerspace, [Digital Naturalism Laboratories](https://www.dinalab.net/). In the rainforest of Gamboa, Panama, Dinalab blends biological fieldwork and technological crafting with a community of local and international scientists, artists and engineers. 

* Hubert Szczgiel

Hubert Szczgiel is a tropical ecologist specializing in scalable biodiversity monitoring. Hubert has worked with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute since 2016. His current research pairs broad-spectrum biodiversity monitoring with new financial tools to enable reforestation. His research inspired the development of the original Mothbox.

* Kit Quitmeyer

Kit Quitmeyer is the Co-founder of [Dinalab](https://www.dinalab.net/), and lead technician of the protoyping facilities. With the Mothbox she has been the head of manufacturing operations and software training. She is a skilled craftsperson passionate about endangered animals, books, activism, and the environment. She works weekly at the [APPC animal rescue in Panama](https://www.appcpanama.org/who-we-are.html), and raises funds with her crafts to support them.

* Bri Johns

Bri Johns is an open science hardware researcher. After her role steering the Gathering for Open Science Hardware group as the community manager, she joined the Mothbox team as a research fellow working on the construction, deployment, and community access for the tool.
