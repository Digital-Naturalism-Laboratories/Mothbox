This is an open source science hardware and software project started by Andy Quitmeyer and Hubert Szczygiel in 2023. The goal is to provide people a low cost tool for insect biomonitoring they can build themselves from off the shelf parts. It aims to be low cost, high resolution, durable, and portable.
