This is an open source science hardware and software project started by Andy Quitmeyer and Hubert Szczygiel in 2023. The goal is to provide people a low cost tool for insect biomonitoring they can build themselves from off the shelf parts. It aims to be low cost, high resolution, durable, and portable.

Here are some video presentations that discuss the motivations behind the Mothbox and its design:
