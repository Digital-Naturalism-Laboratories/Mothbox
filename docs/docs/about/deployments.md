# Panama
## Gamboa, Panama
Near Dinalab has been one of the main testing groundds for its development. It has a harsh tropical environment of heat, humidity, salty air, and microbes that the US Military used to use for materials testing and means that things that can survive being left outside here stand a great chance in other parts of the world! This includes "urban" Gamboa which, because it is in the Canal zone, gets fumigated regularly and seems to have not as much insect Biodiversity these days :( . This also includes areas deeper in the forest like pipeline road or plantation trail which have an abundance of rainforest insects.



## Azuero Penninsula, Panama
One of the first big projects to use the Mothbox is the large community reforestation project headed up by Pro-eco Azuero and Ponterra. The Mothbox is being used by Hubert Szczgiel as part of a multi-modal biodiversity assay to monitor the impact of the reforestation.

We also set one up in Quito, but it is chilly and urban and it got exactly one moth the entire night.
