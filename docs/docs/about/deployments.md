# Gamboa, Panama
Near Dinalab has been one of the main testing groundds for its development. This includes "urban" Gamboa, along with areas deeper in the forest like pipeline road or plantation trail.


# Azuero Penninsula, Panama
One of the first big projects to use the Mothbox is the large community reforestation project headed up by Pro-eco Azuero and Ponterra. The Mothbox is being used by Hubert Szczgiel as part of a multi-modal biodiversity assay to monitor the impact of the reforestation.
