Here's how to build an AI machine vision program from scratch. This will let you use open source projects like YOLO to automatically detect insects in your high resolution photos. This will show you the basics of machine learning programs from setting up your computer, organizing files, training the AI, and processing images

# Setting up your computer

## Programming Software
Download the open source code editing software, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## Labelling Software
First Download the open-source software called ["X-anylabeling"](https://github.com/CVHub520/X-AnyLabeling) 

# Labelling Images

Open X-Anylabelling


# Organizing Files

Put all your labelled image into two folders:
All Images
Backgrounds

Run the Yolo Preparation script

# Training Images


# Detection
