# Pi Debugging Software

You may have noticed that even though the Raspberry Pi is a computer, it doesn't have a mouse or screen. But that's ok! There's special ways you can see what's going on with your raspberry pi by using special software called a "VNC" software.
Download this, and we will be able to look at what's going on inside your computer in a virtual way!
