# Launch Mothbot_UI.py script

This script enables you to run all our post-processing scripts through a web application that runs locally on your computer. We were able to build this interactive user interface using [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio), an open source Python package that allows anyone to quickly build a web application for any sort of machine learning model or Python functions.  

## Make sure you have the latest version of the Mothbox Project on GitHub
Before running your post-processing scripts, it's important to make sure you have the most recent version of our scripts. You can make sure of this by 

## Opening the UI Using Visual Studio Code



## Running Scripts Manually
If you would like to run all of our Python scripts manually, we are including instructions on how to do so as part of each post-processing step listed on our site.
