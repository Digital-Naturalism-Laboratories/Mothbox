During the classification step, we want to take automatically organized insect data and validate them with humans as quickly and accuratley as possible.
We have built two methods to do this so far. The Fiftyone is our older basic functionality method for going through the data, but the newest software "Classify" has a refined, speedy UI.

* Fiftyone - Tried and tested for the past year. A bit clunky in the UI.
* Classify - New UI that is still in development, but provides a great experience.
