# Launch Perceptual Clustering

## Perceptual Clustering Using Mothbot UI

Next, we will run a perceptual clustering script via the Mothbot UI that will help organise our images of organisms (we call these patches) based on visual similarities. It's not 100% perfect, but organising our data visually in this way can save us time later on during the labelling process. 

Begin by clicking the "Cluster Perceptually" tab towards the bottom and clicking the large orange button that says "Cluster Perceptually"

The script should take a few minutes to run and look like this while it's running:

When it's done, it should look like this:

And now you've perceptually clustered your patches!

## Next: Generate and Edit your Datasets

Now that you've detected, identified, and perceptually clustered your data, it's time to move to the final step, which is to generate a dataset of organisms you've detected and label them accordingly. You can head over to the [Generate and Edit Dataset](https://digital-naturalism-laboratories.github.io/Mothbox/docs/processing/databases/) step now!

### Optional: Insert EXIF Data
Before you work with your dataset, you also have the option to attach EXIF data (in a way that is iNaturalist-friendly) to each patch. Head to the [EXIF optional](https://digital-naturalism-laboratories.github.io/Mothbox/docs/processing/insertExif/) step to do this.
