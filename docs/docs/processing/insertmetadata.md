# Launch Insert Metadata

## Using the Mothbot UI to Insert Metadata

Now that our organisms have been identified, it's important to ensure that the correct metadata is associated with the correct data point (i.e. image of the organism identified). For more information on how to organize your metadata, and how to include it in your deployment folder, see the [Organizing Data](https://digital-naturalism-laboratories.github.io/Mothbox/docs/processing/OrganizeData/) step. 

Begin by first making sure you have the correct metadata file uploaded in the additional files processing section.

Then make sure you've selected the "Insert Metadata" tab towards the borrom, and click the large orange button towards the bottom that says "Insert Metadata."

The script should run quickly and look like this when it is finished:

You've now got the appropriate metadata associated with each organism you've identified! 

## Next Step: Perceptual Clustering

You can now move on to the next step, which is running a script that will help cluster the different pictures of organisms you have based on visual similarities. Head to the [Perceptual Clustering](https://digital-naturalism-laboratories.github.io/Mothbox/docs/processing/cluster/) step now!
