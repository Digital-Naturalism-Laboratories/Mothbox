## Insert EXIF Data Using Mothbot UI

We've created a script to insert EXIF data into each patch you've made, which is useful when you want to upload individual patches as photos to crowdsourcing platforms like iNaturalist. You can do this by clicking on the "Insert Exif" tab, then clicking the big orange button that says "Insert Exif"

Once your script is running, it should look like this:

And when it's finished, your window at the bottom should look like this:

You can now head to the next step, [Generating and Editing Datasets](https://digital-naturalism-laboratories.github.io/Mothbox/docs/processing/databases/)!
