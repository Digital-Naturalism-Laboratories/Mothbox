# Download Software to Help Run Post-Processing Scripts
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (This is an interface for running and using code)
* [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)


After you install the above software on your computer (in particular, Python), you can then install some more software in a kind of special magic nerd way.

# Download More Software Using the Terminal

Python installs a special thing called "pip" onto your machine, and you can use pip to install extra open source software and libraries onto your computer super easy!

## Enter Terminal/"Nerd Mode" on Your Computer

### Windows
On a Windows computer you have to open a terminal, but make sure it is in "Adminstrator Mode"
* Click the "Windows" button
* type "cmd"
* Right click the "Command Prompt"
* Select "Run as administrator

#### Commands
Now you can type in these commands and hit enter after each one!

```
pip install pybioclip
```
```
pip install unidecode
```
```
pip install pandas
```
```
pip install pillow
```

```
pip install numpy
```

```
pip install ultralytics
```
(Ultralytics is a big one that might take a while to install)
```
pip install opencv-python
```
(Opencv is another big one)





### Linux or Mac
On Mac and Linux you just open a "Terminal," and then you can run adminstrator level commands by just using the word "sudo" in front of each command you give

#### Commands
Now you can type in these commands and hit enter after each one!

```
sudo pip install pybioclip
```
```
sudo pip install unidecode
```
```
sudo pip install pandas
```
```
sudo pip install pillow
```

```
sudo pip install numpy
```

```
sudo pip install ultralytics
```
(Ultralytics is a big one that might take a while to install)
```
sudo pip install opencv-python
```
(Opencv is another big one)
