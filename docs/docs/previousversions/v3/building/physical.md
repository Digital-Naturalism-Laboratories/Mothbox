# Box bottom connector 

Peel protective plastic of box connectors 
![1000056124](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/2eb399fb-99c9-4c32-9592-3107cd90a916)
Stack box connectors in order F-A

Layer F is the part That will be on the bottom making contact with the tripod.

Layer A will be the top part of this that contacts the box.
I generally assemble them starting from the bottom. 
All the layers should face the same direction with the etching facing in the same direction. The only exception is between layers d and C where you want the etching sides to face each other to make a larger pocket for the Tee nut.
Add ¼ socket Tee nut between layers D and C

Stack box connectors A-F (use zip tie to line up)

Add side flanges (face them towards flat side of layers a-f)

Secure sides with ¼ bolt + nut (loosely is fine)

(Optional) attach tripod shoe

# Modify the Box

## cutting the base holes

We need to make two holes for quarter inch bolts in the bottom of the waterproof box.

After you assembled the bottom base structure, You can use it to set on the bottom of the box to align where your holes need to go. 
![1000056706](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/da57f386-067d-4ccd-ada6-7ddcebd790cd)
![1000056694](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/367d7ba5-7752-4f82-b034-8001880e7af5)


Make sure that everything in the laser cut assembly is flush against the bottom of your box. 
![1000056703](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/f7310c0e-0551-4b90-9c0a-542ded2b2136)

Then you can put a drill bit through the two holes (circled in this image), to lightly drill a mark into the bottom of the box. 
![1000056700](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/072e6194-560a-4e90-a00c-f92d849c054f)

You don't need to drill all the way through at this point just make a reference mark.
![1000056697](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/26a4a96c-9789-4bb4-8cac-0a9ebcfa0e9a)
Next, drill all the way through both of these areas that you have marked.

![1000056763](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/3163603f-b1fc-4ef3-a04f-c41181e6b975)

## drill front lens hole
These boxes our manufactured with a little dot directly in the center of the back of the box. 
You can use this. As a reference to drill a small pilot hole. When drilling this side of the box for the lens make sure to always use a light pressure as you don't want to press too hard and crack the box. 
![1000056684](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/77a53c7b-021e-48bc-b008-b97cb8be1ae7)

After you have drilled the pilot hole, You can get out your 53 mm hole cutter bit. Align this bit with the pilot hole and drill out your hole.

![1000056687](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/ad823238-02a2-4e1a-9eeb-ab2a660f29c1)

Sometimes the edge of this hole can be a little rough and have extra plastic sticking up that can get in the way. You can just take a deburring tool, or a razor, and go along the edge of this cut just to clean it up.

## Epoxy the Lens adapter into place

Mix together some 2-part epoxy on a piece of cardboard with a Popsicle stick. 
![image](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/c548f3d7-8364-433b-a754-d4bed926d0a6)

![image](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/0175facb-cdba-4ee9-8838-f21916fd32b3)

Put a little bit of epoxy onto the rim of the hole you just cut. Add the lens adapter. Use a thin stick to slide around the edge and make sure the epoxy is in all the seam between the lens connector and box.

Then you can use a larger popsicle stick to smooth out the border of the epoxy and have a nice thick seam connecting them.

Use a towel to clean up any epoxy that may have spilled on the inside of the lens adapter.

Once it is in place, and the epoxy is nice and smooth and thick, let it sit aside for several hours to cure.

After the epoxy has dried, sometimes you may notice some white smudges inside your mothbox. These are from the fumes of some glues attaching to oils left from your fingers. This is actually how people do fingerprinting sometimes! You can just wipe it off with a clean, damp cloth
