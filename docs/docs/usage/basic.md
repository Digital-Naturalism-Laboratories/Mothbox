# Charge the Battery before 1st use!
{:.warning}
>When you purchase the batteries, they are often not fully charged! This can be a problem because several people have connected their pi's to a barely charged battery and the low-power causes them to "brown out" and have eeprom errors (where you then have to use the raspberry pi imager to reset the bootloader to get your pi working!)

Save yourself a headache, and charge your battery before you connect it the first time!

# Portable Field Guide

The steps below show you what to do to make sure your Mothbox will run in the field. This is also available as a small print-out that fits inside the Mothbox. We print and laminate them and include them with each Mothbox to make sure everyone knows how to use it. This field guide is available in English and Spanish (and hopefully even more languages soon!).

# Preparation
Before you go to the field, here's a checklist to make sure it is ready for deployment!

- [ ] The battery should always be ON. The switch to the battery should ALWAYS BE IN THE ON POSITION. Open the Mothbox make sure the battery switch is ON (if it's not already on). 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fa99c2d-2f04-4c1a-99c8-b2f886d633de)

- [ ] Charge your Mothbox. This usually takes several hours. Plug it in. Only use the Mothbox charger to charge. You may have other chargers that look similar for other devices, but they are not interchangeable and will not charge the Mothbox correctly. 

![PXL_20240620_193441383](https://github.com/Digital-Naturalism-Laboratories/Mothbox/assets/742627/a425a922-1475-46c4-ae93-56fd8cc75313)

If the plug's indicator is red, the Mothbox is charging. When charger light turns green, the Mothbox is fully charged!

- [ ] USB Storage. Make sure there is external storage with free space plugged in to the Pi's USB to record your photos.

- [ ]  Arm Mothbox. The Mothbox has two jumper wires that keep it from turning itself on until it is deployed. Arm your Mothbox by disconnecting the wires from each other, putting them in the "armed" position.

![PXL_20240909_044023484 MP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22f20af3-9713-4184-bbbf-eb7d25555b91)


- [ ] Check Lights. The RED STANDYBY LEDs should always be on. The Mothbox is set to run automatically according to a schedule, so it probably won't be running when you are setting it up. However, you can visually check that things are ok, because there should be a RED LED light on the Pi (the Pi's off light), and the battery's GREEN lights should always be on. Older models with a Pijuice may also have a BLUE light on as well in standby mode.

- [ ] Add Silica. Add packet of silica drying gel inside box.

- [ ] Close Box. Make sure box is fully closed with all three clips and no wires are caught in the door.

- [X] Item Checklist. Make sure to have all these parts with you **BEFORE you go into the field.**
  - [ ] Mothbox
  - [ ] USB Storage
  - [ ] 4 Arms
  - [ ] 4 Bolts
  - [ ] 4 Nuts
  - [ ] Target
  - [ ] Strap
  - [ ] Security chain and lock (if deploying in places where theft may be an issue)


# Deploy

- [ ] Attach arms to bottom of case with 1/4" screws and nuts. Place target on the end of arms. Ideally, the screws go from the middle of the box out toward the outside edge of the box so that they don't block anything.

![PXL_20240902_193651155 MP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2052454f-9bc5-4f7f-b6ca-ba1a5494c5fb)

- [ ] Hang Mothbox. Using the handle, strap Mothbox to a tree or tripod. Make sure there are no obstacles (like leaves or tall grasses) that may blow between the box and the target and obstruct photos. In general, the Mothbox should be at least 0.5 meters above the ground.

![PXL_20240902_191549638 MP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aed25711-c6c8-450f-bb45-c1efcd3cef86)

Adding a little wrap of the strap around the handle (The Margaret Technique) adds stability to the Mothbox.

- [ ] Inspect Lens. Check lens for dirt and clean with a lens wipe if necessary. **Make sure lens cap is off.**

- [ ] Connect Target. Attaching the target should be one of the last things you do, because you want to protect it from getting dirty. If you have it connected earlier, it could easily bump into wet or dirty plants and get muddy.

![PXL_20240902_194008047 MP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e865c0a-829d-42a7-a484-5b36da4a4b80)

- [ ] Log Data. Write down all the metadata about this deployment on your [field sheet](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeVtBKB8oCWIPIFcEjxCgvnIAEBkRQts0hqxMX58y2VXKmb4A/viewform?usp=sf_link).

{: .warning }
> warning: Don't look directly at UV light. UV light is very bright but invisible to your eye. Eye pain or headaches can occur with long exposure. Use eye protection if working with Mothbox for extended periods while it's on.

{: .note }
> Default schedule: Mothbox will take photos from 19:00-20:00, 22:00-23:00, 1:00-2:00, and 4:00-5:00. If you want it to take photos at different times, change the settings.

# Collect
- [ ] Collect the Mothbox. Make note of any damage, such as water inside case, dirt on target, or physical injury.
- [ ] Disarm the Mothbox with disarming wires (jump wires).
- [ ] Disconnect external storage from the USB port and check out all your cool photos!
- [ ] Backup and organize all the photos from the external storage, and then clean this storage device, deleting all the old folders so it is ready for the next deployment.
- [ ] Charge for the next deployment.

# Manually Turning the Mothbox On and Off
The Mothbox has an internal schedule that lets it stay in a low-power state until it is ready to turn itself on. Sometimes you may wish to **manually trigger** the Mothbox to start running a photo session. Or you may wish to manually turn off a mothbox that has started running.

## Turn It On
You can turn the Mothbox ON by just pressing the "On" button located next to the LED on the Raspberry Pi. Just tap it once, and it will start up.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfb924aa-4b81-4974-ad15-0be8980b2365)


## Turn It Off
You can turn the Mothbox OFF by pressing **and holding** the "On" button for 10 seconds. Just press the button and hold it until the mothbox has shut off.
