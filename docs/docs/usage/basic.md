# Preparation
Before you go to the field here's a checklist of things you go through to make sure it is ready for deployment!

- [ ] The battery should always be ON. Open the mothbox make sure the battery switch it ON (if it's not already on). 
- [ ] Charge your mothbox. This usually takes several hours. Plug it in. Only use Mothbox charger to charge. If the plug's indicator is red, the mothbox is charging. When charger light turns green, the mothbox is fully charged!
- [ ] USB Storage. Make sure there is external storage plugged in to the Pi's USB to record your photos.
- [ ] Attach arms to bottom of case with 1/4" screws and nuts. Place target on the end of arms.


# Deploy
- [ ] Arm Mothbox. The mothbox has two jumper wires that keep it from turning itself on until it is deployed. Arm your mothbox by disconnecting the wires from each other putting them in the "armed" position.
- [ ] Add Silica. Add packet of silica drying gel inside box.
- [ ] Check Lights. The mothbox is set to run according to a schedule automatically, so it probably won't be running when you are setting it up, but you can visually check that things are ok, because there should be a RED led light on the Pi (the pi's off light) and the battery's green lights should always be on.
- [ ] Close Box. Make sure box is fully closed and no wires are caught in the door.
- [ ] Inspect Lens. Check lens for dirt and clean if necessary.
- [ ] Hang Mothbox. Strap mothbox to a tree or tripod. Make sure there are no obstacles (like leaves or tall grasses) that may blow between the box and the target.
