# Documenting Deployments
Equally as important as the photographic data you collect is the metadata about your deployments.

We have printable forms field technicians can take to their sites, or alternatively fill out online like this:

Remember to collect data for EVERY DEPLOYMENT or else it is not useful in the end!

# Structuring Data
Partially automated Insect ID is still a relatively new field, but we are trying to base our meta-data formats off existing types of scientific data collection and processing such as camera trap data.

All the data collected is unique in a specific time and place. Each time-period that a Mothbox is set into the field and then collected is called a "Deployment." A deployment could last several days or even weeks. 

Within space, we currently organizes deployments into different zones.

Country-> Area -> Point


For each individual photo of a single insect we collect, we want it tied to the following information as well:

* occurrenceID
* basisOfRecord
* deployment	eventDate	raw_photo	identified	cv_confidence	class	order	family	genus	species	commonName	scientificName

# Inventory of Mothboxes
If you are running a project with many Mothboxes (more than let's say, 4) you probably want to start keeping an inventory. Field equipment can get lost, forgotten, or busted up, so it's handy to know what you have available if a new opportunity strikes!
Here's an example of how we organize our inventory of mothboxes.
