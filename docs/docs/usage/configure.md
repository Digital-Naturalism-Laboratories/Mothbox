# Change the Timezone
This is probably one of the only things one needs to change with their Mothbox after they first flash the SD card. This guide will show you how to easily get into your Mothbox's brain, however, and customize anything you want!

# Logging in to your Mothbox
## Charge the Battery
{: .warning }
>When you purchase the batteries, they are often not fully charged! This can be a problem because several people have connected their pi's to a barely charged battery and the low-power causes them to "brown out" and have eeprom errors (where you then have to use the raspberry pi imager to reset the bootloader to get your pi working!)

Save yourself a headache, and charge your battery before you connect it the first time!

## Turn the Mothbox "On"

## Connect to the Wifi
