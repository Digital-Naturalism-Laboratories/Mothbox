- UPDATED sudo raspi-update and all that
- Takephoto stores photos in folders with device name now!
- Diagnostics.py can record the sensors
- Diagnostics also allows labels so startup diagnostics are separate than shutdown diagnostics and such
- does v5 board stuff like
-- log light (actually made improvements on arduino script that had lux calculation wrong!)
-- log power
-- log ALL SWITCH STATES at startup!
-There's a dedicated party button now
-Debug switch works
-Active Switch works
-flip camera correctly
- backup remainder changed to 8gb
- update display to refined landscape mode
- scripts for turning attractors and flashes on and off refined
