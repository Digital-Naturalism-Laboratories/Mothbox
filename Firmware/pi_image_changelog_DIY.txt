4.16.4

This image is the latest and greatest for DIY v4 boxes.

Just released a new version of the 4.16 firmware. It has a lot of features I have been waiting to add. Namely:

    Automatically naming the backup folder on the USB after the mothbox’s name
    fixing the battery percent indicator to be a bit more accurate
    blocking mothbox cron functions at boot until the main scheduler.py has fully run (so we can do other sensing more accurately)
    moved “mode” to the controls.txt so other things can read the current mode

Big change: STANDBY mode- doesn’t just turn on when you turn on the mothbox during the day

The big improvement was probably in the UI though. We chunked the information on the epaper a lot better and are working on better fonts that are hinted for low resolution displays (thanks to some person on bluesky who was roasting me over my fonts)
